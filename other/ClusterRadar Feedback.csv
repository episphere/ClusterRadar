Spatial clusters are regions of space that exhibit similar values. You would expect regions to have similar values if the estimate is based on that region.  I.e., if you only have county level data, the county will have similar values. I think that up front you need to define the smallest regions for which there are data. That seems clear from the map label, but I would explicitly say it. Click on the ""x"" that appears to take the location out of focus. I’m not sure where the x is. I had a hard time interpreting the color values on the time scales at first. A general example would go a long way towards clarifying them.  For e.g., the red counties in the northeast indicate high clustering of cancer mortality in 2020 (if that’s correct!!). Zoomed map reel is very cool. But once I selected a few counties I couldn’t figure out how to deselect them and go back to the entire map. Time slider -  Density plots – sometimes the red line isn’t within the two dashed lines. For density plot, cell plot, I realize the description box is right above the plots, but could you include “below” just to make it clear? Also, if you move the view from not showing the 3 figures at the bottom back to showing them, the density plot tutorial box is on top of the figure. Could you add information boxes (i with the circle) to each of the figures at the bottom so that you don’t have to go back to the tutorial to determine what they are? For the 3 figures at the bottom, what are the x-axis values for the density and cell plots?  What does the correlation box mean?  On the right top of the screen, when you hover over the icons (including the github octicat), they don’t show labels.","Not helpful","Yes, and it is worth the additional complexity","Potentially, but it may not be worth the additional complexity","Just because I probably wouldn't use this because of the type of research I do doesn't mean that I think it wouldn't be useful for others.
